"""Locale endpoint for web-remote i18n.

The web remote (served at /remote/) needs to know which locale the
desktop is currently using so it can render the same language without
asking the user. The canonical store lives in electron-conf's
`config.json` written by the main process. The backend reads that file
on each request — cheap (file is small), avoids in-memory staleness
when the user switches language on the desktop.

Falls back to 'en' on any read error so the web remote always boots
even if config.json is missing (fresh install before any locale was
written), unreadable (locked / permission), or malformed.
